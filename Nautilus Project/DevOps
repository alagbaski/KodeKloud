#Create a deployment nagios-deployment for Nagios core.
#The container name must be nagios-container and it must use jasonrivers/nagios image.
#Create a user and password for the Nagios core web interface, user must be xFusionCorp and password must be LQfKeWWxWD. (you can manually perform this step after deployment)
#Create a service nagios-service for Nagios, which must be of targetPort type, nodePort must be 30008.

//SOLUTION:
- First develop a .yaml manifest file to create a nagios deployment pod and service with the provided requirements
- To run the .yaml files run the command below
kubectl apply -f filename.yaml
- After creating the deployment pod and service, you have to create user and password manually
#Run the following commands to create user and password:
- Identify the pod name in which nagios was deployed into
kubectl get all
#OR
kubectl get service nagios-service
#OR
kubectl get pod
kubectl exec -it <nagios-pod-name> -- /bin/bash
cd /opt/nagios/etc/
htpasswd -Bc htpasswd.users <username>
- It will prompt to enter new password.
- Exit and test the Nagios web interface on the terminal

#Install apache2 in "kkloud" container using apt that is running on App Server 3 in Stratos Datacenter
#Configure Apache to listen on port 5004 instead of default http port. Do not bind it to listen on specific IP or hostname only, 
(i.e it should listen on localhost, 127.0.0.1, container ip, etc)
#Make sure Apache service is up and running inside the container.
#Keep the container in running state at the end.

SOLUTION:
- First switch to docker CLI in the required App Server
sudo docker exec -it kkloud /bin/bash
apt install apache2 -y
apt install nano
- Also while in Docker CLI configure the apache2 service to Listen 
sudo nano /etc/apache2/ports.conf
- Look for the line that has Listen = 80 to Listen = 5004
service apache2 restart
service apache2 status
exit
sudo docker ps
