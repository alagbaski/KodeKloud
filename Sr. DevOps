#Create a Puppet programming file games.pp under /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests directory on the Puppet master node i.e on Jump Server.
Define a class ssh_node1 for agent node 1 i.e App Server 1, ssh_node2 for agent node 2 i.e App Server 2, ssh_node3 for agent node3 i.e App Server 3.
You will need to generate a new ssh key for thor user on Jump Server, that needs to be added on all App Servers.

Configure a password less SSH connection from puppet master i.e jump host to all App Servers.
However, please make sure the key is added to the authorized_keys file of each app's sudo user (i.e tony for App Server 1).

SOLUTION:
   class ssh_node1 {
  # generate ssh key for thor user
  exec { 'generate_ssh_key':
    command => 'ssh-keygen -b 4096 -t rsa -f /home/thor/.ssh/id_rsa -q -N ""',
    user => 'thor',
    creates => '/home/thor/.ssh/id_rsa',
  }

  # copy public key to App Server 1
  sshkey { 'thor_sshkey':
    ensure => present,
    type => 'rsa',
    key  => file('/home/thor/.ssh/id_rsa.pub'),
    user => 'tony',
    host => 'app-server1',
    target => '/home/tony/.ssh/authorized_keys',
  }
}

class ssh_node2 {
  # generate ssh key for thor user
  exec { 'generate_ssh_key':
    command => 'ssh-keygen -b 4096 -t rsa -f /home/thor/.ssh/id_rsa -q -N ""',
    user => 'thor',
    creates => '/home/thor/.ssh/id_rsa',
  }

  # copy public key to App Server 2
  sshkey { 'thor_sshkey':
    ensure => present,
    type => 'rsa',
    key  => file('/home/thor/.ssh/id_rsa.pub'),
    user => 'tony',
    host => 'app-server2',
    target => '/home/tony/.ssh/authorized_keys',
  }
}

class ssh_node3 {
  # generate ssh key for thor user
  exec { 'generate_ssh_key':
    command => 'ssh-keygen -b 4096 -t rsa -f /home/thor/.ssh/id_rsa -q -N ""',
    user => 'thor',
    creates => '/home/thor/.ssh/id_rsa',
  }

  # copy public key to App Server 3
  sshkey { 'thor_sshkey':
    ensure => present,
    type => 'rsa',
    key  => file('/home/thor/.ssh/id_rsa.pub'),
    user => 'tony',
    host => 'app-server3',
    target => '/home/tony/.ssh/authorized_keys',
  }
}

# include classes for each agent node
include ssh_node1
include ssh_node2
include ssh_node3
###
In this file, we define three classes: ssh_node1, ssh_node2, and ssh_node3 for each App Server.
In each class, we use the exec resource to generate an ssh key for the thor user and the sshkey resource to copy the public key to the tony user's authorized_keys file on each App Server.

Finally, we include all the classes to ensure they are executed.
After creating this file, you can apply it using the following command:
  
  sudo /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet apply /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests/games.pp

##
This will set up the password-less SSH connection from the Puppet master node to all the App Servers with the key added to the tony user's authorized_keys file.
