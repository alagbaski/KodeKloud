#To Configure Apache to listen on port 6200, Also Configure Apache to add some redirects
Normally apache includes configurations from the etc/apache2/sites-available/ folder, it could have some configuration on there.
if it doesn't exist, just create a new include on that folder and create the folder. and you will have configurations like this as a configuration's file content:

 <VirtualHost *:6200>
    ServerName stapp03.stratos.xfusioncorp.com
    Redirect permanent / http://www.stapp03.stratos.xfusioncorp.com/
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost *:6200>

#To find all files owned by the user "anita" in the directory /home/usersdata and copy them to the /beta directory while preserving the directory structure,
you can use the following command:

      find /home/usersdata -type f -user anita -exec cp --parents {} /beta \;
      
#NB: The command will use the 'find' command to search for all files (-type f) owned by the user "anita" (-user anita) in the directory /home/usersdata,
and for each file found, it will use the 'cp' command to copy it to the /beta directory while preserving the directory structure (--parents).
The {} symbol is a placeholder for the filename found by 'find', and the \; symbol indicates the end of the 'exec' command.
Also,  note that this command will only copy files owned by the user "anita" and not any directories or subdirectories.
If you also want to copy directories owned by the user "anita", you can remove the '-type f' option from the command.

#To hide the version number of the Apache web server, you can modify the Apache configuration file located at /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf on the App-Server.
Open the file in a text editor and locate the following line:
   
   ServerTokens OS

Change it to:

   ServerTokens Prod

Also, add the following line to the file:

   ServerSignature Off
   
Save the file and exit the editor.

   Options FollowSymLinks
   
Save the file and exit the editor.

#The steps to change the default runlevel to boot in GUI mode may vary depending on the operating system being used on the app servers.
However, the general steps are as follows:
Enter the command to edit the default runlevel configuration file.
For example, on a system using systemd, the command may be:
   
   sudo systemctl set-default graphical.target
 
//Alternative:
    - Log in to the server as root or a user with sudo privileges.
    - Open the file "/etc/inittab" with a text editor.
    - Locate the line that starts with "id" and has a default runlevel number (usually 3 or 5).
    - Change the default runlevel number to 5, which is the runlevel for GUI mode.
    - Save the file and exit the text editor.
NB:
It is important to note that changing the default runlevel can have consequences on the system's behavior and security.
Therefore, it is advisable to test the changes in a non-production environment before implementing them in a production environment.
Also, make sure to document any changes made to the system for future reference.

#To install cron-job package, start crond service and add a cron job for root user on a App-Servers

     sudo yum install cronie
     sudo systemctl start crond
     
#Add a cron job for root user to echo "hello" every 5 minutes:
   
     sudo crontab -e
     */5 * * * * echo hello > /tmp/cron_text
Save and exit the file.

- This will run the cron job every 5 minutes and append "hello" to the file /tmp/cron_text.
- You can verify that the cron job is running by checking the contents of the file /tmp/cron_text.
