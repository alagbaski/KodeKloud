 <VirtualHost *:6200>
    ServerName stapp03.stratos.xfusioncorp.com
    Redirect permanent / http://www.stapp03.stratos.xfusioncorp.com/

======================
#To find all files owned by the user "anita" in the directory /home/usersdata and copy them to the /beta directory while preserving the directory structure,
you can use the following command:

      find /home/usersdata -type f -user anita -exec cp --parents {} /beta \;
      
#NB: The command will use the 'find' command to search for all files (-type f) owned by the user "anita" (-user anita) in the directory /home/usersdata,
and for each file found, it will use the 'cp' command to copy it to the /beta directory while preserving the directory structure (--parents).
The {} symbol is a placeholder for the filename found by 'find', and the \; symbol indicates the end of the 'exec' command.
Also,  note that this command will only copy files owned by the user "anita" and not any directories or subdirectories.
If you also want to copy directories owned by the user "anita", you can remove the '-type f' option from the command.
